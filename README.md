All it does is display the current Swatch Internet Time as a status.

Swatch Internet Time is a concept of time measurement introduced in 1998 by the Swatch Corporation. Each day is divided into 1000 beats. There are no time zones; instead, beat 000 matches up with midnight at UTC+1. Read more from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time).

Practical for eliminating the confusion of timezones when scheduling meetups and events on the internet.
